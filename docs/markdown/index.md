# Linux Things

This is a repo I built for me in order to make my life easier around managing some linux personal projects.

I will include in this repo possible projects using raspberry py or how to compile python from scratch in linux.

It contains a broad line of things that have in common one thing: **they all run/require linux**.

Main projects:

### Raspberry

Here I have a few personal projects I run on my Raspberry Pi 4

#### Media Home Server

Maturing nicely.

#### Face Expression Detection

Nothing running so far. I might remove it in the future.
